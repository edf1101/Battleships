# ECM1400 Battleships

## Introduction
A python application to simulate a Battleships game against an AI in both a command line interface and a Flask GUI.

## Coursework Self assessment
All features required by specification are complete.
### Additional 
#### Entry Screen
The user can select the game settings (size, difficulty) on an Entry page.
Game screen has a return to menu button so games can be replayed
#### Storm Mode
When this is turned on The board will shift 1 space each turn in a predetermined direction
#### HTML Template sunken ships
If a ship has been sunk, the main.py script sends a list of sunk positions for
either the AI or Player to the HTML code, and it colours those tiles green
#### AI attacking
There are 5 AI difficulties [code here](advanced_ai.py)
0. Pure Random Guessing
1. Random but it won't guess same space twice
2. Guessing a random position around unsunk hits
3. Trying to guess in a line around unsunk hits
4. Guesses in a line if there are unsunk hits, if none it calculates the probability of a ship being in any 
unguessed tile and guesses there

Wrote [a script](ai_comparison.py) to test AI's against each other
